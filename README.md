WishList

1. Modelling Processes
- Brownian Process >> dX_t = dB_t , where B_t - B_s ~ N (0,t-s) 
- Brownian Process with drift and diffusion >> dX_t = u * dt + sigma * dB_t   [ u and sigma can be time and stock price dependent ] 
- Geometric Brownian Process >> dX_t = u * X_t * dt + sigma * X_t * dB_t
- Ornstein Uhlenbeck Process >> -k * X_t * dt + sigma * dB_t

2. Ito's Lemma (For stochastic calculus differential)
- Stochastic Calculus
- Taylor Series (Multi Variable)

3. Fokker Planck (Forward Kongomorov) and Backward Kongomorov


4. Volatility Model 
- Heston Model 


5. Linear Algebra 
- Cholesky Decomposition (Factorisation for matrices)
